# Building Redis using Rust 

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to my journey of building a Redis in Rust using the [CodeCrafters](https://app.codecrafters.io/catalog) platform. Redis is an in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker.

## File Structure

- All files are inside the directories.

## Dependencies

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - The programming language used for this project.

## License

This project is licensed under the [MIT License](/LICENSE).

## Acknowledgments

- [CodeCrafters](https://app.codecrafters.io/catalog) for providing a platform to practice and improve Rust skills.
- The Redis community for inspiring this project.

Happy coding!
