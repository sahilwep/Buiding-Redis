# Building Redis using Rust 

I created this repository to monitor my personal development in building Redis using Rust on the CodeCrafters platform.

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to my journey of building a Redis in Rust using the [CodeCrafters](https://app.codecrafters.io/catalog) platform. Redis is an in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker.

## File Structure

All files are inside the directories.
  1. [bind-to-a-port](/bind-to-a-port/src/main.rs)
  2. [respond-to-ping](/respond-to-ping/src/main.rs)
  3. [respond-to-multiple-ping](/respond-to-multiple-ping/src/main.rs)
  4. [handle-concurrent-client](/handle-concurrent-client/src/main.rs)

## Dependencies
